/**
 * The screen stack the user left, so the next launch can put it back.
 *
 * Holds a snapshot of the live activity stack -- each screen's class, the extras it was launched
 * with, and whatever that screen chose to record through [Restorable] -- as JSON under
 * `filesDir/resume_state.json`. `filesDir` and not `cacheDir`: this backs a setting the user turned
 * on, and a cache the OS is free to reclaim would turn it off again at random.
 *
 * Two launch routes have to be handled, and the difference between them is the whole design:
 *
 * - **From the launcher.** The process is new and Android starts [MainActivity] alone.
 *   [buildRestoreIntents] hands it the screens that were above it so it can replay them.
 * - **From recents, with the process dead.** [MainActivity] never runs; the system recreates only
 *   the activity that was on top, and the ones below it come back lazily on Back. [seedFromSnapshot]
 *   rebuilds the live stack underneath that top screen, without which the next [capture] would
 *   refuse the snapshot for not being rooted at [MainActivity] and the user would lose it.
 *
 * Nothing here runs unless the setting is on: every entry point checks first, so a user with it off
 * pays one preference read per activity creation and one per transition, and nothing else. In
 * particular no screen is ever asked to describe itself or to name itself, which is what keeps the
 * three screens that serialize an object graph from costing anything to someone who never turned
 * this on.
