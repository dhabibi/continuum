/**
 * Decodes a feed row's picture into Glide's memory cache before the row binds, so it arrives with the
 * picture already in the box rather than a blank that the picture then replaces.
 *
 * Both families, since the pop-in is the same on either: a compact row's square thumbnail and a
 * card's full-width preview. Which of them a post gets, and at what size, is
 * [PostRecyclerViewAdapter.previewPreloadRequest]'s answer, not this class's.
 *
 * It comes at that from two sides. While the list scrolls, the rows just past the edge it is moving
 * towards are warmed ([PreloadWindow]). And a refresh is held until the screen it opens on has been
 * warmed ([prewarm]), so a feed opens, or a pull-to-refresh swaps, with every thumbnail in place.
 *
 * Every request comes from [PostRecyclerViewAdapter.previewPreloadRequest], the builder the row's own
 * load uses, at the size the row will decode to. That is the whole trick: Glide's memory cache is keyed
 * on the url, the size and the transformation, so a bitmap warmed any other way would sit unused while
 * the row decoded its own.
 *
 * Main thread only, like the adapter it reads.
