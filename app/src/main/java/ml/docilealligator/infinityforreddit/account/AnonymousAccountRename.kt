 * The rows are handled by `RedditDataRoomDatabase.MIGRATION_41_42`; two things outside the database
 * also stored the old spelling and are corrected here.
 *
 * Both steps are idempotent and cost two preference lookups on a launch that has nothing to do, so
 * there is no "already done" flag to keep in step with them.
 *
 * Must run before anything reads the current account: every settings read resolves through the
 * account name, so a background fix-up could lose a race with the first activity and route a whole
