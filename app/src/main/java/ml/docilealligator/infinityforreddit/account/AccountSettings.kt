/**

 *
 * Backs the three things a static classification makes possible: copying another account's settings
 * onto this one, putting this one back where a newly added account starts, and — through
 * [AccountStoredData] — throwing away one kind of them on its own. All three are exact because
 * [AccountScopedKeys] already answers, for every key, whether it belongs to an account.
 *
 * Like [AccountSettingsMigration] this opens the preference files itself rather than taking them
 * injected: the injected ones are [AccountScopedSharedPreferences], which show only the current
 * account's view of a file, and both whole-account operations here have to reach a second account's
 * keys.
 *
 * Everything writes with `commit()`. [copyBetweenAccounts] and [reset] are followed immediately by
 * an app restart, and `apply()` only promises the write eventually reaches disk — the process is
 * gone before then. [resetFile] keeps it for a duller reason: it already runs off the main thread,
 * so the write costs nothing there and has landed by the time its caller reports success.
