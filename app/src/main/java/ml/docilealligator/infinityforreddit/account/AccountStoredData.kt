/**
 * One account's accumulated data, thrown away a kind at a time.
 *
 * These sit beside the whole-account operations in [AccountSettings] on the Account Settings
 * Management screen, and they are what used to be the Advanced screen's "Delete All" actions. Each
 * is deliberately narrow: this account's subscription list, its followed and saved users, the sort
 * order a feed remembers, the layout a feed remembers, where Home had reached, the screen stack it
 * left behind, which posts have been read, and the tags it has put on other users. None of them is
 * a setting anyone chose on a settings screen, which is why they are worth clearing without
 * resetting the settings that were.
 *
 * Every function is scoped to one account and touches no other's, which is what separates them from
 * the actions left on Global Settings Management — the theme library and the legacy keys have no
 * account to belong to.
 *
 * All of them block. Call them off the main thread.
