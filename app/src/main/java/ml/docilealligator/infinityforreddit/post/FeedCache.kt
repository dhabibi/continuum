/**
 * The posts a feed had loaded when the user last left it, so a resume can put them back without a
 * network call.
 *
 * Same trick as [ml.docilealligator.infinityforreddit.utils.SavedPostCache], for the same reason:
 * [Post] has no JSON serializer, so the bodies are kept as the raw t3 listing children and rebuilt
 * through [ParsePost.parsePostsSync] on load. The post filter and read-post metadata are therefore
 * re-applied at load time, and changing either needs no invalidation.
 *
 * Two things differ from that cache, both because this one backs a user-visible setting rather than
 * an optimisation:
 *
 * - **`filesDir`, not `cacheDir`.** Losing a cached saved list costs a refetch. Losing this one
 *   silently turns "Resume where I left off" off, so it does not live somewhere the OS reclaims.
 * - **No TTL.** A resume is valid however long the app was closed; staleness is the user's problem
 *   to fix with a pull-to-refresh, exactly as it is in Slide.
 *
 * Metadata (version, timestamp, `after` cursor) lives inside each entry's own file rather than in a
 * SharedPreferences index. A new prefs file would have to be registered in the settings
 * backup/restore plumbing, and a resume snapshot has no business travelling in a settings backup.
